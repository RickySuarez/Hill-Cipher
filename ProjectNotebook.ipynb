    "For my project, I decided to code a unique method of encryption. This encryption uses the Hill Cipher in order to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Hill Cipher works by using a matrix that is invertible modulo $256$. That is, given a matrix $A$, there exists another matrix $B$ such that $AB ≡ I \\mod{256}$. In other words, given a column matrix $\\vec{x}$, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $A\\vec{x} ≡ \\vec{y} \\mod{256}$\n",
    "- $B\\vec{y} ≡ \\vec{x} \\mod{256}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I wanted to be able to encrypt while having as little input from the user as possible. To accomplish this, I designed the Encryptor class in a way that randomly generates a valid matrix-inverse pair once an Encryptor object is made. Once the Encryptor object has been made, you can use the `Encryptor.encrypt(str)` and `Encryptor.decrypt(str)` functions in order to encrypt and decrypt a string respectively. Everything else is handled within the function. Note that this only work for the characters with unicode values up to $256$ since otherwise there could be overflow issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the functions/methods I have written are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Encryptor.matrix_generator()`: \n",
    "    - Returns two numpy arrays matrix,inverse that are valid inverses of each other.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "- `Encryptor.encrypt(str)`: \n",
    "    - An instance method that accepts a string str and returns a string encryption of str.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "- `Encryptor.decrypt(str)`: \n",
    "    - An instance method that accepts a string str and returns the string decryption of str.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `Encryptor.gcd_extended(m, n)`: \n",
    "    - Takes two integers m,n and returns gcd, x, y where:\n",
    "        - gcd is the greatest common divisor of m and n\n",
    "        - x is the Bezozut coefficient of m\n",
    "        - y is the Bezout coefficient of n\n",
    "        <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `matrix_operations.cofactor(np, i, j)`:\n",
    "    - Takes in a numpy array and indices i,j and calculates the cofactor for the entry located at row i and column j.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `matrix_operations.determinant(np)`:\n",
    "    - Takes in a numpy array and calculates the determinant if it is square or raises an exception if it is not square.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `matrix_operations.submatrix(np, i, j)`:\n",
    "    - Takes in a numpy array and indices i,j and returns a submatrix where the ith row and jth column of np are deleted.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `matrix_operations.transpose(np)`:\n",
    "    - Takes in a numpy array and returns the transpose as a numpy array.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "- `matrix_operations.adjoint(np)`:\n",
    "    - Takes in a numpy array and returns the adjoint as a numpy array.\n",
    "    <p>&nbsp;</p> \n",
    "        \n",
    "An interesting piece of information is about how I made the `matrix_generator()` function. Within the function, there is a `while` loop that terminates when the greatest common divisor of the determinant of the randomly generated matrix and $256$ is $1$. This is necessary to determine if an inverse exists for the matrix. However this begs the question: what will happen if the greatest common divisor is never $1$? In theory, this would mean the loop would never end.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is highly unlikely. Consider the probability of generating a valid matrix after exactly $k$ iterations. Since $2^8$ is the prime factorization of $256$, this means that $\\gcd(256,a)=1$ $\\iff a$ is odd. If we assume there is a uniform distribution across all possible determinants, then we have that the probability of receiving an invalid matrix is $\\frac{128}{256}=\\frac{1}{2}$ at each iteration. Therefore, the probability of receiving a valid matrix after $k$ iterations is $P(k)=\\frac{1}{2^k}=2^{-k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, let's say we want to know how likely it is that the while loop ran for $20$ iterations. Then $P(20)=2^{-20}\\approx 0.00000095$. As you can see, this is highly unlikely. In fact, the expected number of iterations in total is $2$. Now for infinitely many iterations, we have: $$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} P(k) = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} 2^{-k} = 0$$\n",
    "Therefore in practice, this will most likely never happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I know the math is interesting, but it is best to see this code work in practice. Below is a demonstration of how creating multiple Encryptor objects will lead to different encryption results but will ultimately still allow the encoded messages to be decrypted. "

    "I do have a fairly large amount of programming experience. Of all the programming languages I know (Java, MATLAB, C, C++, Python) Python is the one I have the least amount of experience with. One hurdle that I had to overcome was in how to represent matrices as a numpy array. After working on this project though, I have discovered that much of the arithmetic works similarily to MATLAB so adjusting was not an overly difficult thing to do. I feel that my project has gone above and beyond the project requirements because I was able to provide a method of encryption that is not a simple substitution of characters, leans heavily into my background in mathematics, and offers users an easy way to access a complex encryption strategy without having to understand the modular linear algebra behind it. Furthermore, I had to make a decision over whether a while loop approach was worth doing. After calculating the likelihood that a loop would run for many iterations, I decided that my approach would work well which is something I have never done before."
